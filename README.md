Several classic ciphers implementation, which includes Caesar cipher, Vigenere cipher and Transposition cipher. The program is able to do both encryption and decryption work for all these three kinds of ciphers by receiving an input from the user.

 * The "Message.java" file is the source code.
 * The file named "Tester.java" works as a checker, which explains one more time what is the mathematical logic behind these encryptions and what is expected to output.
